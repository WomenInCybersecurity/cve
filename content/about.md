## 👋 About Me

Hey there! I’m an Application Security Engineer focused on making sure the apps we all use are safe and secure 🛡️. I work closely with development teams to find and fix security issues—whether it’s through vulnerability assessments, penetration testing, or helping build security into the software development process from the start 🧑‍💻🔐.

I’ve done everything from digging into source code with tools like Snyk, Checkmarx, Veracode, and Fortify 🧩, to running hands-on web app penetration tests 🕵️‍♂️. I also focus a lot on integrating security into CI/CD pipelines ⚙️ and making sure teams have the tools and knowledge to build secure software every step of the way 🛠️.

This blog is my space to share what I’ve learned (and am still learning!) about AppSec, DevSecOps, CVE analysis 🧠, and the tools that make it all happen—like Burp Suite, Nmap, and others I use during pentests 🧪. If you’re into secure coding, threat modeling, or just curious about how security fits into software development—you’re in the right place 👨‍🏫🚀.
